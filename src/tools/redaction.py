"""Shared redaction helpers (CWE-209/497, P10).

Two independent concerns live here:

1. ``redact_internal_paths`` — replaces internal root prefixes with a
   ``'<redacted>'`` sentinel, keeping the relative tail. Caller-supplied or
   external absolute paths stay intact for diagnosability; only our own
   topology is hidden. Idempotent and regex-free (zero ReDoS surface).
2. ``redact_payload`` / ``is_sensitive_arg`` — recursively scrub sensitive
   keys from structured tool-call payloads before they reach any event
   stream, trace, or live audit ledger. Two key classes are scrubbed:
   credential keys (OAuth tokens, ``api_key``, ``authorization``, secrets)
   matched by exact name or ``*token*``-style marker, and a curated set of
   exact account/PII field names (``account_number``, ``ssn``,
   ``routing_number`` …). The opaque ``account_ref`` provenance field is
   deliberately preserved (SPEC §5 accountability chain).
   Promoted from the swarm worker's private copies (#142) so
   the swarm worker, the live-action audit, the main agent loop, and the
   paper-trading surfaces all consume one shared implementation.
