"""Shared HTTP helpers for direct-API loaders: per-host throttling + JSON/CSV GET.

Several free providers — Eastmoney most notably — rate-limit by source IP and
will temporarily ban a client that bursts requests. Rather than scatter sleep
calls across loaders, every ban-prone call routes through :func:`throttled_get`
here, which enforces a minimum spacing between consecutive requests to the same
*host bucket* (plus a little jitter so concurrent workers don't lock-step) and
reuses one :class:`requests.Session` per process so TCP/TLS setup is amortized.

This module is intentionally provider-agnostic: it knows nothing about
Eastmoney/Sina/Stooq field layouts, only how to space requests politely. A
loader picks its own ``host_key`` and ``min_interval`` and stays ignorant of
the locking mechanics.

All spacing is best-effort and process-local — it does not coordinate across
machines. For batch jobs raise the relevant ``*_MIN_INTERVAL`` env var.
